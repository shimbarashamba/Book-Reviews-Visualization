# Book Reviews Visualization
A short data analysis visualization project about Amazon book reviews. The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews

I have checked the distribution of ratings (1-5 stars), the average review score over time, amount of reviews over time, what types of books are controversial using the standard deviation of review scores and finally the distribution of helpfulness ratios of reviews.
